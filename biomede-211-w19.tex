\section{How can I print off and use this document?}
Frankly, in just about any way that’s useful to you. I am going to try something here, where I will try to make more or less the entirety of the notes associated with the Winter 2019 semester of BIOMEDE 211, ”Circuits, Systems, and Signals in Biomedical Engineering”, to you, dear reader.
\\
Please don’t plagiarize this. If you were raised right, you ought to know what that is. If you’d like my judgment on any sort of action, my opinions can be laid bare.
\\
The first assignment I am giving you (worth 4\% of your grade and which must be completed by the end of the semester) is to figure out where this document is located online, download it, print it off, sign your name to it, and get it to me. If you know who I am, I would expect a competent engi- neer to find that without much to-do about it. Start with Google, go from there. Further, for those in the class, BIOMEDE 211, Winter 2019, you must join Github and make at least four substantive contributions to this repository. The term all you engineers (and lawyers) can’t wait to parse is “substantive” to which I will always enter a judgment which I deem final in this class, and I am ever in favor of beneficence over stricture. So, just help out the class in a way you think is helpful and watch those around you do the same. Failure to contribute to this living document by the end of the semester for those in this class will result in a loss of up to 4\% of one's total grade outright.

\minitoc



\section{What is electricity?}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item A form of energy resulting from the existence of charged particles 
	\item The physical phenomena arising from the existence, presence, and motion of charged particles
	\item Rather ill-defined in common vernacular – we will generally avoid its use
\end{enumerate}



\section{Charge}
 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Charge is the property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field; measured in coulombs (C)
	\item 	Charges are found in nature in discrete, integral multiples of electronic charge: e  = -1.602 x $10^{-19}$ C (the charge of one electron)
	\item \textbf{How many electrons are needed to form one coulomb?} (What is the weight of all those electrons?) 
	\item One byte is eight bits. Bits are essentially a single electron stored in a transistor. \textbf{If we were to take all the electrons from one terabyte of well distributed information (equal number of ones and zeros), how many coulombs would we have?}
\end{enumerate}


\section{Current}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The time rate of change of charge – charges (charged particles) in motion; measured in amperes; defined mathematically as
	\begin{equation}
	\label{i=dqdt}
		i := dq/dt
	\end{equation}
	where $i$ is current, $q$ is charge, and $t$ is time
	
	\item Conversely, the total charge transferred over time can be expressed as 
	\begin{equation}
	\label{q=it}
		Q := \int_{t_0}^{t}i dt
	\end{equation}

	\item 1 ampere is equal to 1 coulomb/second
	\item Direct current, ``DC'', is current that remains constant with time
	\item Alternating current, ``AC'', is current that varies sinusoidally with time
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{The directionality of current}
Ultimately, the direction in which we say "current" flows is largely arbitrary. As arbitrary as choosing one type of charge and calling it ``positive'' and another ``negative''. The reason it doesn't matter is that the only consequence of having chosen a ``wrong direction'' for the current in a given analysis is that we have to switch the sign of the value. Thus, 3 amps in one direction is \textit{the exact same thing }as -3 in the opposite direction.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Thanks to Benjamin Franklin we say that current is 
	\subitem i.	\textbf{Positive in the direction in which positively charged particles flow} and 
	\subitem ii.	\textbf{Negative in the direction in which negatively charged particles}
	\subitem iii.	We also now know that current results primarily from the movement of negatively charged particles (electrons) and therefore our convention is “wrong” in one sense, though convenient and entrenched enough that we’re not liable to change it in our life time (besides, the math comes out the same, and the actual flow of electrons will only matter to us in a few special circumstances, diodes)
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{The at times deadly serious nature of current}
Much of the point of learning this material here is its eventual application by our hands or by the hands of those we work with. Before we put any of this stuff in our hands, we should probably know what is and is not safe.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 1 mA, you will feel
	\item 10 mA, you will really feel
	\item 100 mA, you will likely die
	\item 1000 mA, you will definitely die
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{The ``speed'' of current}
A possible misconception is that the electrons inside a wire travels at the speed of light. The speed of current is actually relatively slow. If one were to imagine an electron starting at the wire next to a light switch in an average classroom, it would take a very long period of time for it to travel to the light itself. The light's immediate reaction to a switch is due to a ''hose effect''; the electrons inside the wire push other electrons in the direction opposite to the [conventional] current. This cascade of electrons is what happens close to the speed of light, not the electron movement itself.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item T\textbf{he \textit{signal} of electrical current (that is electromagnetic radiation) travels anywhere between about 50-99\% the speed of light} (dependent on a number of conditions) depending upon the material through which it travels (based on a “dielectric” behavior known as permittivity)
	\item \textbf{The drift velocity of electrons} within a copper wire is ~25 $\mu$m/s, so how does anything ever turn on?
	\item \textbf{The hose effect} - The electrons at the light switch will almost certainly never pass through a light bulb, but they will move around and bump into their neighbors which bump into their neighbors which bump into their neighbors, etc., until it causes the electrons nearest the light to pass through. This is how water at a spigot is able to push water at the end of a hose.
\end{enumerate}



\section{Potential (difference)}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The amount of work needed to move a unit of (positive) charge from a reference point to another point [without producing an acceleration]).
	\item Potential is measured in ``volts'' and is often called ``voltage''. In this class we will endeavor to avoid such a term as it can be very confusing to talk about potential as if there were such a \textit{thing} as voltage.
	\item Defined as 
	\begin{equation}
		v:= \frac{dw}{dq}
	\end{equation}
	\item Potential describes the \textit{potential} to do something. Increasing the potential is akin to increasing the height of a cliff. The height does not \textit{do} anything other than increase what can be done on the drop. If potential is the cliff's height, charge would be pebbles you'd drop off the side, and current describes how fast those pebble fall.
	\item In this class, and for the vast vast majority of electrical engineering work, we care about the \textit{difference} in potential. One element held at 100 billion volts and another held at 100 billion + 1 volts has a \textit{potential difference} of 1 V, which is less than a single AA battery.
	\item Voltage can also be thought of as how badly the current "wants" to flow, while current is the actual flow of charges per second. Since charge flows but not the voltage, voltage can exist without current - a single charge induces a voltage. On the other hand, current can't exist without voltage since having a current means that charges are flowing, and if charges are flowing there is a potential difference across the charges. 
	\item Some typical voltages to be aware of
	\subitem \textbf{Consumer level batteries} (AA, AAA): 1.5 V (DC); 9 V (DC) 
	\subitem \textbf{Car batteries}: 12 V (DC)
	\subitem \textbf{The ``mains''} (levels provided by power companies to consumers): 110-120 V (AC) and 220-240 V (AC) in America
	\subitem \textbf{Power transmission lines}: 110-1200 kV (AC), transformers are used to step up and down the potential before used by consumers
\end{enumerate}



\section{Power}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The time rate of expending or absorbing energy.
	\item Quantifies the rate of energy transfer.
	\item Mathematically:
	\begin{equation}
		p = \frac{dw}{dt} = \frac{dw}{dq}\cdot\frac{dq}{dt} = v\cdot i
	\end{equation}
	\item Measured in watts: 1 W = 1 $\frac{\text{J}}{\text{s}}$ = 1 $\frac{\text{N}\cdot \text{m}}{\text{s}}$ = 1 $\frac{\text{kg}\cdot \text{m}^2}{\text{s}^3}$ = 1 V $\cdot$ 1 A
	\item \textbf{Passive sign convention}: If current enters through the positive terminal of an element, $p = +vi$; if current enters through the negative terminal of an element, $p = -vi$.
\end{enumerate}



\section{Energy}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The capacity to do work.
	\item Measured in joules.
	\item $E = \int\frac{dw}{dt}dt \rightarrow$ power x time
	\item J = $\frac{\text{kg}\cdot\text{m}^2}{\text{s}^2}$ = N $\cdot$ m = Pa $\cdot$ m$^3$ = W $\cdot$ s = C $\cdot$ V
\end{enumerate}



\section{Conservation}
Here, as elsewhere, things will be conserved. In electrical circuits there are two laws of conservation that will matter most for us:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{The Conservation of Mass.} The conservation of mass means that no mass can be added to or removed from a circuit without being accounted for. Put differently, in a closed system (the type we will concern ourselves with here) no mass is added or removed.
	\subitem In electrical circuits, the mass we care the most about are the charges whipping around. Thus, for us, \textit{the amount of charge within a circuit must remain constant.}
	\item \textbf{The Conservation of Energy.} The conservation of energy means that no energy can be added to or removed from a circuit without being accounted for. Put differently, in a closed system (the type we will concern ourselves with here) no energy is added or removed.
	\subitem In electrical circuits, the energy we care the most about is the potential provided by sources and depleted by other elements in the circuits. Thus, for us, \textit{the sum of potentials within a circuit must equal zero.} 
\end{enumerate}

In evaluating circuits, the main focus of the first third of this class, it will be the application of these two conservative laws that will enable us to ``solve'' them. That is, by understanding (1) how energy is generated and used and (2) how charges move around in closed loops (``circuits'') we will be able to predict the behavior of the myriad electrical systems which may cross our paths.

\section{Active v. passive}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Active elements are capable of generating energy while passive components cannot
	\item \textbf{Active}: generators, batteries, operational amplifiers, ``sources''
	\item \textbf{Passive}: resistors, capacitors, inductors, i.e., most circuit elements
\end{enumerate}

\section{Ohm's Law and what it means}

Ohm's Law is concerned with the relationship between voltage, or potential difference, and current across a conductor.  The potential difference across a conductor is proportional to the current flowing thorugh the conductor with the proportionality constant being denoted as R, or resistance.  This can be expressed as:

	\begin{equation}
	\label{V=iR}
		V := iR
	\end{equation}
	
This essentially states that the drop in potential across the conductor, or resistor, is equivalent to the current flowing through the conductor and its resistance.  When considering impedance, the equation can be modified to state:

	\begin{equation}
	\label{V=iZ}
		V := iZ
	\end{equation}

\section{Sources}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{An ideal independent source} is an active element that provides a specified value of potential or current, regardless of other circuit elements.
	\subitem Batteries and power supplies may be approximated as ideal potential sources.
	\item \textbf{An ideal dependent (or controlled) source} is an active element in which the source quantity is controlled by another quantity (such as potential, current, temperature, measured resistance, etc.).
	\item \textbf{An ideal potential source} will produce any current required to ensure that the terminal voltage stated is satisfied.
	\item \textbf{An ideal current source} will produce any voltage required to ensure that the terminal current as stated is satisfied
	\item Symbols
	\subitem Voltage-controlled voltage source, VCVS
	\subitem Current-controlled voltage source, CCVS
	\subitem Voltage-controlled current source, VCCS
	\subitem Current-controlled current source, CCCS 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Resistors}
\textbf{Resistors} are electrical (circuit) elements that resist the flow of electric charge (current); passive two-terminal components that implement a defined/``constant'' resistance; meant to reduce current flow and change potential

\subsection{Resistance, $R$}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Resistance} is the physical property describing an element's ability to resist current and is most often represented by $R$
	\item Resistance is measured in ``ohms'', $\Omega$, which is equivalent to 1 V/A
	\item Resistance is one half of a broader physical phenomenon known as \textbf{``impedance''} - the property describing an element's ability to \textit{impede} current. Impedance is typically represented by $Z$, which we'll explore more thorough in a bit.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Resistivity, $\rho$}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The resistance of an element (such as a resistor) depends on three things: 
	\subitem \textbf{Resistivity}, $\rho$, of the material comprising the element, which is the \textit{material}'s ability to resist the flow of charges; measured in ohm-meters
	\subitem \textbf{Length}, $l$, of the element; measured in meters
	\subitem \textbf{Area}, $A$, of the cross-section of the element; measured in m$^2$
	\subitem Such that $R = \rho\frac{l}{A}$
	\subsubitem What units are we left with?
	\subsubitem What are the effects of length and area?
	\item \textbf{Materials with low resistivity} are generally called (and treated as) ``conductors'' as they are able to more effectively \textit{conduct} the motion of electrical charges than materials with high resistivity
	\item \textbf{Materials with very high resistivity} are generally used as ``insulators'' as they prevent the flow of current through them and thus \textit{insulate} the current within prescribed bounds, such as with a copper wire with plastic wrapped around it.
\end{enumerate}

Here is a link to a video that further explains the concepts of resistivity and resistance: \url{<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rsswT_Rv1M>}.

\subsection{Conductance}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The inverse of resistance is conductance, $G$, which describes the ability of an element to conduct current
	\item Measured in Siemens
	\item Allows us express Ohm's law slightly differently, $i = Gv$, which says that the current generated through an element by a potential is directly proportional to some constant, namely conductance.
	\item The material specific property \textbf{conductivity}, $\sigma$ is measured in S/m
\end{enumerate}

\section{Capacitors}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Passive two-terminal components that store energy in an electric field; introduces capacitance to a circuit.
	\item Can be thought of as two conductive plates sandwiching a ``dielectric'' material. Essentially it is two ``conductors'' separated by a ``non-conductive region''.
	\item When a capacitor is attached across a source, an electric field develops across the dielectric causing a net positive charge to collect on one conductor and a net negative charge to collect on the other.
	\item We can define the capacitance of an element mathematically as 
	\begin{equation}
		C = Q/V
	\end{equation}
	where $C$ is capacitance in farads, $Q$ is positive or negative charge on each conductor, and $V$ is the potential between them
	\item We can also represent capacitance by the voltage-based rate of charge accumulation: $C = dQ/dV$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Its time varying behavior}
Unlike resistors, capacitors have a \textit{time-varying} element to that. That is, since $C = Q/V$, $V = Q/C$.

If we then recall Equation \ref{q=it}, we can write the time-dependent potential relationship of a capacitor
\begin{equation}
	V(t) = \frac{Q(t)}{C} = \frac{1}{C}\int_{t_0}^{t} i(\tau) d\tau + V(t_0)
\end{equation}

We can also recall\footnote{We could also take the derivative of the equation preceding this one and do a little rearrangement. As it turns out, these physical relationships are rather codified and thus can be gotten out by any number of means.} Equation \ref{i=dqdt}, and represent the time-dependent current relationship as
\begin{equation}
	I(t) = \frac{dQ(t)}{dt} = C\frac{dV(t)}{dt}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Charge accumulation}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item While charges accumulate on a capacitor, no current flows \textit{through} the capacitor.
	\item \textbf{Well, then why use them? After awhile won't the current just stop?} Yes, indeed it will -- in a DC circuit!
	\item The capacitor will become ``charged'' over time, eventually reaching the same potential as that established across it, e.g., by a source. Since potential only ever travels down potential gradients, if the capacitor and the source (say, a battery) are at the same potential, no current will flow.
	\item Thus, a fully charged capacitor will act as an ``open'' circuit, while an uncharged capacitor will act as a ``short'' circuit.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{A simple example}
If we consider Ohm's law for a simple RC circuit (one in which a source, a resistor, and a capacitor are in series), we can describe the system by

\begin{align}
	V_0 &= v_{R}(t) + v_{C}(t) \\
	V_0 &= i(t)R + \frac{1}{C}\int_{t_0}^t i(\tau)d\tau
\end{align}
Taking the derivative of both sides:
\begin{align}
	0 &= R\frac{di(t)}{dt} + \frac{1}{C}i(t) \\
	0 &= RC\frac{di(t)}{dt} + i(t) \\
	i(t) &= \frac{V_0}{R}\cdot e^{-t/RC} \\
	v(t) &= V_0\left(1 - e^{-t/RC}\right) \\
	Q(t) &= C\cdot V_0\left(1 - e^{-t/RC}\right)
\end{align}


\section{Inductors}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Passive two-terminal components that store energy in a magnetic field
	\item Can be thought of as an insulated wire wound into a coil around a core (which may either be filled with a material or left open to the environment)
	\item Behavior can be modeled as $L = \frac{\Phi}{I}$, where $L$ is the inductance, $\Phi$ is the magnetic flux generated by a current, $I$.
	\item By Faraday's law of induction, voltage induced by a change in magnetic flux through a circuit is
	\begin{equation}
		v = \frac{d\Phi}{dt}
	\end{equation}
	which we can rewrite as
	\begin{equation}
		v = \frac{d}{dt}(Li) = L\frac{di}{dt}
	\end{equation}
	\item In this class, at this level, and for most biomedical applications you're liable to experience in your tenure, you will not work extensively with inductors. However, you should be able to recall at least this much at a moment's notice to be able to ascertain a system's behavior.
\end{enumerate}




\section{Impedance}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The measure of opposition a circuit element presents to a current when a potential is applied. (It is measured in ohms.)
	\item It is ``complex'' in two sense of the term. First, the actual phenomenon itself comprises complex numbers; that is, there is both a ``real'' and an ``imaginary'' component.
	\subitem \textbf{The real component} is known as resistance, $R$
	\subitem \textbf{The imaginary component} is known as reactance, $X$
	
	Impedance can be represented as a combination of either
	\subitem \textbf{Resistance and reactance}: $\mathbf{Z} = R + \jmath X$, where $\mathbf{Z}$ is impedance, $R$ is resistance, and $X$ is reactance, or
	\subitem \textbf{Magnitude and phase}: $\mathbf{Z} = |Z|e^{\jmath \theta}$, where $|Z|$ is the magnitude of the impedance vector, $\mathbf{Z}$, and $\theta$ is the phase of said vector (i.e., the delay between current and potential). Phase, $\theta$ is equivalent to $\tan^{-1}(X/R)$
	\item Impedance is also complex in the sense that it is complicated. The impedance of an object is a factor of many parameters including permittivity, geometry, quantum states, thermal stability, etc. Let us not view this sort of complexity as an impediment to our understanding of impedance.
	\item The inverse of impedance is \textbf{admittance}, $Y$, and comprises a real component, \textbf{conductance}, $G$, (which is the inverse of resistance) and an imaginary component, \textbf{susceptance}, $B$ (which is the inverse of reactance). (It is measured in Siemens.)
	\subitem $\mathbf{Y} = G + \jmath B$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{A quick note on ``imaginary'' numbers}
The term ``imaginary'' is an unfortunate name for an excellent mathematical tool. All the imaginary operator -- in this class represented by $\jmath = \sqrt{-1}$ -- is is a type of number ``orthogonal'' to our ``real'' numbers. Imaginary numbers are no less ``real'' than real numbers. Unfortunately, they aren't necessarily the most intuitive to our little mammalian brains and thus we must be trained to work with them. However, as we will see in this class, they can be quite useful.

\section{Equivalent impedance}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item It will often be more convenient to think about the impedance which a component burdens a system with (or the conductance which it affords) rather than its resistance. \textbf{Therefore, we need to begin to think in terms of equivalent impedances as we start to evaluate circuits.}
	\item Recall Ohm's law 
	\subitem \textbf{Resistors}, $v = iR \qquad \qquad \rightarrow Z_{eq,R} = R$
	\subitem \textbf{Capacitors}, $v = \frac{1}{C}\int i dt \quad \rightarrow Z_{eq,C} = \frac{1}{\jmath \omega C}$
	\subitem \textbf{Inductors}, $v = L\frac{di}{dt} \quad \qquad \rightarrow\jmath \omega L$
	
	I want to plant a flag here for you to notice the relationship between the $\jmath \omega$ terms from the capacitor and inductor and the corresponding derivative and integral forms of current in the Ohm's law representation. This will become very important once we get into the Laplace and Fourier transforms.
	\item We must also recognize that few will be the circuits comprising but a single element. As such, we should know how to find the equivalent impedance of many elements.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Impedances in general}
\textbf{Series}
\begin{equation}

\subsection{A few examples}
\textbf{Example 1}
Find the equivalent resistance, if a resistor $R_1 = 10 \text{ k}\Omega$ is connected in parallel to $R_2 = 3.3 \text{ k}\Omega$.

\textit{Solution}. $R_{eq} = \frac{R_1 \cdot R_2}{R_1 + R_2} = \frac{(10)(3.3)}{10 + 3.3} = 2.48 \text{ k}\Omega$
\\
\\
\textbf{Example 2}
Find the equivalent resistance of three parallel-connected resistors of equal value. If $R = R_1 = R_2 = R_3 = 10 \text{ k}\Omega$, what's $R_{eq}$?

\textit{Solution}.
Recall, Equation \ref{req,par}
\begin{equation}
	\frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \frac{1}{R} + \frac{1}{R} + \frac{1}{R} \rightarrow 3R_{eq} = R \rightarrow R_{eq} = \frac{R}{3} \rightarrow R_{eq} = \frac{10k}{3} = 3.33 k\Omega
\end{equation}
\\
\\
\textbf{Example 3}
Four resistors are connected in parallel. $R_1 = 10 \text{ k}\Omega$, $R_2 = 1 \text{ k}\Omega$, $R_3 = 5 \text{ k}\Omega$, and $R_4 = 3 \text{ k}\Omega$. Calculate their equivalent resistance.
\begin{align}
	\frac{1}{R_{eq}} &= \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + \frac{1}{R_4} \\
	\frac{1}{R_{eq}} &= \frac{1}{10k} + \frac{1}{1k} + \frac{1}{5k} + \frac{1}{3k} \\
	&= 612.3 \text{ }\Omega

\section{Some details}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/op-amp1}
\\
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/op-amp2}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Behaves like a voltage-controlled voltage source
	\item They can amplify, sum, subtract, multiply, differentiate, integrate
	\item They are active circuit elements
	\item Though they have somewhat more complicated internal workings, we typically represent them in electrical circuits as a triangle with three (sometimes five) very important terminals:
	\subitem An inverting input (— sign, typically represented up top for convenience, but it need not be)
	\subitem A non-inverting input (+ sign, typically on bottom)
	\subitem An output
\end{enumerate}

\section{Some rules}
There are \textbf{three important features of ideal operational amplifiers} that we must understand thoroughly. These are things worth stamping in your brain.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Infinite open-loop gain.} The ``A'' of the gain is infinitely large such that any difference in voltages $V_1$ and $V_2$ causes an enormously large output voltage. As much as is being supplied. (The real value of gain in most operational amplifiers is between $10^{5}$ and $10^8$.)
	\item \textbf{Infinite input impedance.} Current cannot travel between the inverting and non-inverting terminals. (Really, the impedance is between $10^5$ and $10^13$ ohms and is often signal dependent.)
	\item \textbf{Zero output impedance.} There is no loss transmitting a voltage difference to the output. (Really is about 10-100 ohms and is chip dependent.)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Some conveniences}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item With infinite input impedance, no current can flow into or out of the terminals and hence $i_1$ and $i_2$ are equal to 0.
	\item Since no current flows across the terminals, the terminals are at equal potential. Hence ``$v_1 = v_2$''.
\end{enumerate}

Some extra facts with operational amplifiers are that they can be combined with a capacitors to create different filters. Adding a capacitor in series with the input resistor creates a "high-pass filter" amplifier, where it passes signals with frequency higher than a specific cutoff frequency and attenutates signals lower than the cutoff. Adding a capacitor in parallel with the feedback resistor creates a "low-pass filter" amplifier, where it passes signals with frequency lower than the cutoff and attenuates signals higher than it. The corner frequency for the cutoff may be caulcated with f=1/(2piRC). Having both capacitors would create a band-pass filter which attenuates signals lower than the lower cutoff and higher than the upper cutoff frequencies.

\newpage
\section{Some examples}

\subsection{Inverting amplifier}
We will apply the conservation of mass at this point to solve our equations.  This is among the simplest and most effective ways to add gain to a circuit. So much so that you will use it again and again and again in life and especially in labs

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/op-amp3}

We apply KCL at the node for v1
\begin{enumerate}
	\item I1 – i2 – i3 = 0
	\item I3 = 0
	\item I1 – i2 = 0
	\item I1 = i2
	\item I1 = (vi – v1)/R1
	\item I2 = (v1 - Vo)/Rf
	\item (vi – v1)/R1 = (v1 - Vo)/Rf
	\item V1 = V2 = 0
	\item Vi/R1 = -Vo/Rf
	\item Vo = -Rf/R1 * Vi
	\item R2/R1 is our gain, gain factor.
\end{enumerate}




\subsection{Non-inverting amplifier}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/op-amp4}

Again, the name might imply what it does. It will amplify our input signal without inverting it.

We can again perform Nodal analysis.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item I1 – i2 – i3 = 0
	\item I3 = 0, since no current enters the non-inverting input
	\item I1 = i2
	\item (Vg – v2)/R1 = (v2 – Vo)/Rf
	\item –v2/R1 = (vi – Vo)/Rf
	\item Vo = (1 + Rf/R1) * Vi
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Voltage follower}

\section{Nodes and branches}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{A branch} is any two-terminal element. (examples: Resistor, Capacitor, Wire, etc.) 
	\subitem \textit{\textbf{A branch} is any two-terminal element. What are some two-terminal elements we’ve learned?}
	\item \textbf{A node} (junction) is a point of connection between two or more branches. 
	\subitem \textit{\textbf{A node} is a point of connection between two or more branches. Often indicated by a dot. What else have we called a node? A junction.}
	\item A loop is \textbf{independent} if at least one branch is not part of any other independent loop. 
	\subitem \textit{\textbf{A loop} is any closed path within a circuit. A closed path formed by starting at a node, passing through a set of nodes, returning to the starting node without passing through any node more than once.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Seven Bridges of Konigsberg}
The Königsberg bridge problem asks if the seven bridges of the city of Königsberg (left figure; Kraitchik 1942), formerly in Germany but now known as Kaliningrad and part of Russia, over the river Preger can all be traversed in a single trip without doubling back, with the additional requirement that the trip ends in the same place it began.

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics{figures/04.konisberg.png}
\end{center}



\subsection{Independence}
A loop is independent if it contains at least one branch which is not a part of any other independent loop
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Each of the loops in the circuit at right are independent 
	\item Independent loops lend themselves to sets of equations to be solved!
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Fundamental theorem of network topology}
Fundamental theorem of network topology states that the number of branches, $b$, must equal the sum of the independent loops, $l$ and nodes, $m$ minus one, that is
\begin{equation}
	b = l + n - 1
\end{equation}

With this fundamental theorem we can also “redefine”/”refine” our definition of series and parallel.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Series} | two or more elements share a single node and thereby carry the same current
	\item \textbf{Parallel} | connected to the same two nodes and thereby have the same voltage across them (potential difference)
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}

\newpage
\section{Kirchhoff's Laws}
I am not personally a fan named laws of nature, especially ones which are mere recapitulations of already perfectly good laws. Thus do we introduce Kirchhoff’s laws, known as 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Kirchhoff’s current law (``KCL'') 
	\item Kirchhoff’s voltage law (``KVL'')  
\end{itemize}
	
These are, as far as I’m concerned, mere restatements of \textit{the conservation of mass} and \textit{the conservation of energy}, respectively.


\subsection{Kirchhoff's Current Law}
\textbf{Kirchhoff's current law} states that any node (junction) in an electrical circuit, the sum of currents flowing into that node is equal to the sum of currents flowing out of that node.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Put differently, the algebraic sum of currents entering a node (or any closed boundary) is zero
	\item For those mathematically inclined among us, that is: $\sum_{x=1}^n i_x = 0$
	\item Another way this often gets stated is by saying that the algebraic sum of charges within a system cannot change and is thus sometimes referred to as ``the conservation of charge''.
	\item Well since all of our charge carriers are merely particles (electrons, protons, ions, etc.), this is just another layer over the top of the underlying law which is that mass cannot be created or destroyed.
	\item However, Kirchhoff's formulation of this law (conserving charge, mass) is useful in circuits as it gives us a great tool, being able to say that current going in is equal to current going out
	\item For the figure $i_1 + (-i_2) + i_3 + i_4 + (-i_5) = 0 \rightarrow i_1 +i_3 + i_4 = i_2 + i_5$
	\item KCL forms the basis of a technique we’ll spend the next couple of lectures on known as “nodal analysis” because we evaluate the current going into and coming out of nodes
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics{figures/04.node.png}
\includegraphics{figures/04.single-loop-kvl.png}

\subsection{Kirchhoff's Voltage Law}
Kirchhoff's voltage law states that the sum of electrical potential differences (voltage) around any closed network is zero
\begin{itemize}
	\item That is, for any closed path (loop), the sum of voltages is zero.
	\item Mathematically: $\sum_{m=1}^{M} v_m = 0$, where M is the number of voltage drops (caused by circuit elements) in the loop and vm is the $m$th voltage drop
	\item The sum of voltage rises = the sum of voltage drops
	\subitem $v_1 + (-v_2) + (-v_3) + v_4 + (-v_5) = 0$
	\subitem $v_1 + v_4 = v_2 +v_3 + v_5$
	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{A few examples}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Simple 1 Vs – 1 R circuit; Vs = 10, R = 1 kohm, I = 0.01 A / 10 mA
	\item Simple 1 Vs – 2 R in series; Vs = 10, R = 1 kohm, I = 0.005 A / 5 mA
	\subitem \textit{What does KCL tell us? (Current is the same through  resistors). }
	\item Simple 10 mA source, 2 R (1 kohm) in parallel; What is the voltage?
	\subitem $i_1 + (-i_2) + (-i_3) = 0 ] \rightarrow i_1 = i_2 + i_3 \rightarrow i_1 = V/R_1 + V/R_2$ 
	\subitem $0.01 = V/1000 + V/1000 \rightarrow 0.01 = 2V/1000 \rightarrow 0.010/2*1000 = 5$ V
	\subitem \textit{Nodes are at the same voltage!}
	\item 10 mA up, 5 mA down, 2 R (1 kohm), Rl (500 ohm), all in parallel. What is the current through load Rl? [have someone come to the board and solve]
	\subitem When current sources are in parallel they add together 
	\item For the circuit shown below, use KCL to find the remaining branch currents
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics{figures/04.example2.png}
\\
\includegraphics{figures/04.example3.png}

\end{center}

For Figure 2.13, you know to use KCL because the circuit contains two current sources. Ideal current sources will deliver whatever potential is necessary to obtain the desired current so we don't know how potential behaves through it.
If we look at node x and arbitrarily set $i_1$ as entering the node from the left, $i_2$ as exiting the node down the branch containing the resistor, and $i_3$ as entering the node from the right, then:
\subitem $i_1 - i_2 + i_3 = 0$
\subitem $2i_0 - i_0 + 5 = 0$
\subitem $i_0 = - 5 A $
The negative sign just means that the arbitrary direction we chose for our analysis is opposite of the actual direction of current flow

For Figure 2.77, start at a node with only one unknown current such as the upper right node.
\subitem $2 - i_4 - 4 = 0$
\subitem $i_4 = -2 A$
Repeat the process for remaining nodes
\subitem $7 + i_4 - i_3 = 0$
\subitem $i_3 = 7 + (-2) = 5 A$

\subitem $-i_2 - 3 - 7 = 0$
\subitem $i_2 = -10 A$

\subitem $i_1 + i_2 - 2 = 0$
\subitem $i_1 = 2 - (-10) = 12 A$

We could check our work by performing nodal analysis at the last node. However, it is not a necessary step as we have already found the desired unknowns.



\newpage
\section{Nodal analysis}
Nodal analysis | a general circuit analysis technique in which we try to determine the potential difference between nodes by applying KCL and KVL (in my experience, usually focusing a bit more on KCL)

Your textbook offers the following description of the technique which seems pretty good to me:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Select a node as a reference. Assign voltages ($v_1, v_2, ..., v_{n-1}$) for the remaining n-1 nodes, all of which will be referenced with respect to the reference node.
	\item Apply KCL to each of the n-1 nonreference nodes. Use Ohm’s law to express the branch currents in terms of node voltages.
	\item Solve the resulting simultaneous equations (system of equations) for each unknown node voltage.
	\item It's as easy as that! But, well, actually, it can get a little hairy once you start to apply it in earnest.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{The procedure}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics{figures/04.typical-nodal-circuit.png}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Begin by putting a reference, usually a ``ground''
	\subitem This ground can be one of two sorts: (1) \textbf{Earth ground} in which ultimately the whole earth is used as the reference point; or \textbf{Chassis ground} in which the case of the device in which the circuit is in will act as a reference as it will presumably be sufficiently large as to serve fine [this is also partly the reason why you can ``feel'' a MacBook charge up – its charger does not utilize a traditional ``earth ground''
	\subitem Either will suffice for our purposes here
	\item Next we label all the nodes.
	\subitem How many branches, nodes, and loops?
	\subitem 5 branches, 3 nodes, 3 loops. Satisfies our network condition. 
	\subitem You can give them any label you want, but I find working your way up from the ground in a clockwise manner and numbering them sequentially is a good habit to get into.
	\subitem Keep in mind that we typically set our reference node to have a voltage of 0. We can actually set it to be anything we’d like, but the math is often easier if we just make it 0.
	\item Then we apply KCL to each nonreference node in the circuit.
	\subitem At node 1, $IA - i1 - i2 - IB \rightarrow IA = IB + i1 + i2$
	\subitem At node 2, $IB + i2 - i3  IB + i2 = i3$
	\subitem Once we’ve got that, now it’s a matter of applying Ohm’s law. Thought typically written as V = iR, it is perhaps more helpful to write its full extension here and note that (Va – Vb) = iR
	\subsubitem $I = (Va - Vb)/R$
	\subitem Thus we can state
	\subsubitem $I1 = (v1 - v0)/R1 	\rightarrow I1 = G1(v1 - v0)$
	\subsubitem $I2 = (v1 - v2)/R2 \rightarrow I2 = G2(v1 - v2)$

\end{enumerate}





\section{Solving simultaneous equations}
\subsection{Cramer's Rule}
When given a system of linear equations, Cramer's Rule allows us to solve directly for the specific variable whose value we are looking for.

To use Cramer's Rule, the system of equations must satisfy two conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item There must be the same number of equations as variables (the coefficient matrix must be a square).
	\item The determinant of the coefficient must be non-zero.
\end{enumerate}

Use the following steps to apply Cramer's Rule:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Write the coefficient matrix of the system (call this matrix A). Make sure this is a square matrix; otherwise Cramer's Rule is not applicable.
	\item Compute the determinant of matrix A. Make sure that this value is non-zero; otherwise Cramer's Rule is not applicable here.
	\item Suppose the first variable of the system is x. Write the matrix Ax by placing the column of numbers to the right of the equals sign as the first column of Ax and using the non-x coefficients of matrix A as the remaining columns.
	\item The value of x is the determinant of Ax divided by the determinant of A.
	\item Repeat steps 3 and 4 to solve for any other variable as needed.
\end{enumerate}

Example implementing Cramer's Rule:
We will use the following system of equations to demonstrate how to use Cramer's Rule to solve for the value of x:

\begin{center}
x + y + z = 4
-x + 2y = 1
-y + z = 1
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Write the coefficient matrix A and check that it is a square matrix:
		\begin{center}
		\[
  		A=
  		\left[ {\begin{array}{ccc}
   		1 & 1 & 1\\
   		-1 & 2 & 0\\
   		0 & -1 & 1\\
  		\end{array} } \right]
		\]
		\end{center}
	\item Solve for the determinant of A. (|A| = 4). The determinant does not equal zero.
	\item Write the matrix Ax:
		\begin{center}
		\[
  		Ax=
  		\left[ {\begin{array}{ccc}
   		4 & 1 & 1\\
   		1 & 2 & 0\\
   		1 & -1 & 1\\
  		\end{array} } \right]
		\]
		\end{center}
	\item Solve for the determinant of Ax. (|Ax| = 4). 
	\item Solve for the value of x:
		\begin{center}
		x = $\frac{|Ax|}{|A|}$
		x = 1
		\end{center}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Problem 5}
(10 points) During an in vitro (petri dish) experiment, the peak electric power that a group of stem cells can tolerate without some serious functional consequence is known to have a threshold of about 1 mW. If the power delivered to this group of cells is defined as $p(t) = 2e^{-t}\sin 5t$ [mW], will the cell be harmed and if so how long can power be delivered before the cells are harmed?

\section{Problem 7}
(10 points) Hospitals often employ what is known as a dynamic uninterruptible power system (D-UPS) comprising a diesel generator, a synchronous machine, and a kinetic energy unit. By way of example, if the energy to a particular hospital fails, the kinetic energy unit continues to feed 600 kW to the hospital for 20 seconds, allowing the generator and synchronous machine to take over and feed the load.
\begin{enumerate}

$v(t) = B \cos \omega t$.
	\item Plot current, voltage, and energy as functions of time using MATLAB (or an equivalent software package). You may use any values of $A$, $B$, and $\omega$ that you’d like, but unit values (=1) might make your life/work easier. (Present the code you used to arrive at your plot.)
\end{enumerate}


\section{Problem 9}
(10 points) The materiality of the human body ensures that it puts up some resistance to the flow of current. Find some values of impedance for the following human body parts.

\section{Clarifications on the homework}

\section{Mesh analysis}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A mesh is a loop which does not contain any other loops within it.
	\item ABEF and BCDE are meshes. ABCDEF is not.
	\item We apply KVL to find the mesh currents within a given circuit (this can be particularly helpful / convenient when dealing with parallel circuits).
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics{figures/05.mesh1.png}
\end{center}

\section{Steps of mesh analysis}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{For each of your $n$ meshes assign a mesh current ($i_1$, $i_2$, ..., $i_n$).} You may draw them in any direction you want, but generally a nice clockwise direction will help with consistency.
	\item \textbf{Apply KVL to each of the n meshes.} Use Ohm’s law to express the voltages in terms of the mesh currents
	\item \textbf{Solve the resulting n simultaneous equations to get the mesh currents.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Important condition for use}
Unlike nodal analysis, mesh analysis only works for ``planar” networks'' | that is one which can be written in two-dimensions without any branches.\footnote{Nonplanar networks can still be solved using nodal analysis.}

\section{An example}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/05.mesh2.png}

For the example seen above, we might at this point in our lives be tempted to solve the circuit with branch currents (the current that actually flows into and out of every branch. That is certainly a valid way by which to look at the problem. But now we're going to try another. We're going to try to understand ``mesh currents''.

Those branch currents can be formed into a pair of coupled equations
\begin{eqnarray}
	V_A - R_1 i_1 - R_3 i_3 = 0 \\
	V_B - R_2 i_2 - R_3 i_3 = 0 
\end{eqnarray}

We can also apply KCL at the node between the three resistors and recognize a third bounding equation: $i_1 + i_2 - i_3 = 0$. We can then solve these three equations through any number of means (substitution, elimination, etc.).

But mesh analysis allows us to model the situation more simply and often more efficiently.

We begin by defining two arbitrary mesh currents, $i_1$ and $i_2$. Then we apply KVL as we do a ``walk'' around the loop defined by the mesh current.
\begin{eqnarray}
	V_A - R_1i_1 - R_3(i_1 - i_2) = 0 \\
	-R_3(-i_1 +i_2) - R_2i_2 - V_B = 0
\end{eqnarray}
This given us two equations with two unknowns (the arbitrary mesh currents, $i_1$ and $i_2$, we defined).

\section{Another example}
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics{figures/05.mesh3.png}
\end{center}

For the circuit above, let's try to find the branch currents by performing mesh analysis (i.e., by. first finding the mesh currents).

\textbf{Solution.}

Obtain mesh current using KVL. For mesh 1:
\begin{equation}
	-15 + 5 i_1 + 10(i_1 - i_2) + 10 = 0
\end{equation}
which simplifies to 
\begin{equation}
	3i_1 - 2i_2 = 1
	\label{mesh1}
\end{equation}

For  mesh 2:
\begin{equation}
	6i_2 + 4 i_2 + 10(i_2 - i_1) - 10 = 0
\end{equation}
simplifying to
\begin{equation}
	i_1 = 2i_2 - 1
	\label{mesh2}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Solving it one way}
Perhaps the technique we'd most likely reach for if we knew nothing else about a situation is substitution. In this case, let's substitute equation \ref{mesh2} into equation \ref{mesh1}:
\begin{equation}
	6i_2 - 3 - 2i_2 = 1 \rightarrow i_2 = 1 \text{ A}
\end{equation}
And plugging that result back in
\begin{equation}
	i_1 = 2i_2 -1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \text{ A}
\end{equation}

And thus $I_3$ being equal to the difference in current between $i_1$ and $i_2$ is equal t zero.


\subsection{Solving it another}
Another way of doing this is by recognizing some of the techniques afforded to us by linear algebra. If we squint at the equations with a little bit of good brain wrinkling, we can see that 
\begin{equation}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		3 & -2 \\ -1 & 2
	\end{bmatrix}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		i_1 \\ i_2
	\end{bmatrix}
	=
	\begin{bmatrix}
		1 \\ 1
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
is just as valid of way of putting it as any other.

In this form we can use a few techniques to solve for the unknowns. One technique to be aware of given its deployability in those times in which you might need to write out your work is \textit{Cramer's rule}.

Cramer's rule says that 
\begin{eqnarray}
	i_1 = \frac{\Delta_1}{\Delta} \\
	i_2 = \frac{\Delta_2}{\Delta}
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{eqnarray}
	\Delta = 
	\begin{vmatrix}
		3 & -2 \\ -1 & 2
	\end{vmatrix}
	= (3)(2) - (-1)(-2) = 4 \\
	\Delta_1 = 
	\begin{vmatrix}
		1 & -2 \\ 1 & 2
	\end{vmatrix}
	= (1)(2) - (1)(-2) = 4 \\
	\Delta_2 = 
	\begin{vmatrix}
		3 & 1 \\ -1 & 1
	\end{vmatrix}
	= (3)(1) - (-1)(1) = 4 \\
\end{eqnarray}
Thus
\begin{eqnarray}
	i_1 = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \\
	i_2 = \frac{4}{4} = 1
\end{eqnarray}
which agrees with the results we obtained before.



\section{Yet another example}
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics{figures/05.mesh5.png}
\end{center}
Let's begin by defining the mesh currents (flowing clockwise around each mesh)

\begin{center}
	\textbf{Mesh 1}
\end{center}
\begin{equation}
	20(i_1 - i_3) + 10(i_1 - i_2) - 70 = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{center}
	\textbf{Mesh 2}
\end{center}
\begin{equation}
	10(i_2 - i1) + 12(i_2 - i_3) + 42 = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{center}
	\textbf{Mesh 3}
\end{center}
\begin{equation}
	20(i_3 - i_1) + 14i_3 + 12(i_3 - i_2 = 0
\end{equation}

Putting the equations into standard form:
\begin{eqnarray}
	30i_1 - 10i_2 - 20i_3 = 70 \\
	-10 i_2 +22 i_2 - 12 i_3 = -42 \\
	-20 i_1 - 12i_2 +46 i_3 = 0
\end{eqnarray}

In matrix notation that becomes:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		30 & -10 & -20 \\ -10 & 22 & -12 \\ -20 & -12 & 46
	\end{bmatrix}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		i_1 \\ i_2 \\ i_3
	\end{bmatrix}
	=
	\begin{bmatrix}
		70 \\ -42 \\ 0
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
While this can be solved any number of ways, in MATLAB one can simply write \texttt{I = R/V}, which should tell you something about what is ``going on'' mathematically in these operations.


\section{Writing mesh equations directly in matrix form}
Let's take a look at yet one more example.
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics{figures/05.mesh6.png}
\end{center}

We might, by now, begin to appreciate that one of our matrices is simply the resistances (impedances) of a mesh bundled up in one matrix, the currents bundled up in another, and the potentials bundled up in another, shown below.

\begin{equation}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} \\
		r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} \\
		r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} \\
	\end{bmatrix}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		i_1 \\ i_2 \\ i_3
	\end{bmatrix}
	=
	\begin{bmatrix}
		v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

To properly assemble these matrices there's just a few simple rules.


First, let's take a loop around each mesh and determine the equivalent impedance (of that mesh!)
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Mesh 1.} $R_2 + R_5 + R_6$
	\item \textbf{Mesh 2.} $R_2 + R_1 + R_3$
	\item \textbf{Mesh 3.} $R_3 + R_6 + R_5$
\end{itemize}

These will comprise values along the diagonal of the resistance (impedance) matrix ($r_{11}$. $r_{22}$, and $r_{33}$).

Next, let's look for elements that are shared among meshes
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Mesh 1 \& 2} share $R_2$, so $r_{21}$ and $r_{12}$ both become $-R_2$
	\item \textbf{Mesh 2 \& 3} share $R_3$, so $r_{23}$ and $r_{32}$ both become $-R_3$
	\item \textbf{Mesh 3 \& 1} share $R_5$, so $r_{13}$ and $r_{31}$ both become $-R_5$
\end{itemize}

Thus, our entire resistance matrix becomes

\begin{equation}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} \\
		r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} \\
		r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} \\
	\end{bmatrix}
	=
	\begin{bmatrix}
		(R_2 + R_5 + R_6) & -R_2 & -R_5 \\
		-R_2 & (R_2 + R_1 + R_3) & -R_3 \\
		-R_5 & -R_3 & (R_3 + R_6 + R_5) \\
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

The matrix it buts up against is easy enough to construct, it is simply the mesh current of each mesh

\begin{equation}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		i_1 \\ i_2 \\ i_3
	\end{bmatrix}
	=
	\begin{bmatrix}
		i_1 \\ i_2 \\ i_3
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
	
And the potential matrix is the sum of sources in the direction of the mesh current

\begin{equation}
		\begin{bmatrix}
		v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3
	\end{bmatrix}
	=
	\begin{bmatrix}
		-v_A + v_B \\ v_A \\ -v_B
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Giving rise to a final form which can be solved efficiently by any computation engine we put before us.
\begin{equation}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		(R_2 + R_5 + R_6) & -R_2 & -R_5 \\
		-R_2 & (R_2 + R_1 + R_3) & -R_3 \\
		-R_5 & -R_3 & (R_3 + R_6 + R_5) \\
	\end{bmatrix}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		i_1 \\ i_2 \\ i_3
	\end{bmatrix}
	=
	\begin{bmatrix}
		-v_A + v_B \\ v_A \\ -v_B
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\section{How can I print off and use this document?}
Frankly, in just about any way that’s useful to you. I am going to try something here, where I will try to make more or less the entirety of the notes associated with the Winter 2019 semester of BIOMEDE 211, ”Circuits, Systems, and Signals in Biomedical Engineering”, to you, dear reader.
\\
Please don’t plagiarize this. If you were raised right, you ought to know what that is. If you’d like my judgment on any sort of action, my opinions can be laid bare.
\\
The first assignment I am giving you (worth 4\% of your grade and which must be completed by the end of the semester) is to figure out where this document is located online, download it, print it off, sign your name to it, and get it to me. If you know who I am, I would expect a competent engi- neer to find that without much to-do about it. Start with Google, go from there. Further, for those in the class, BIOMEDE 211, Winter 2019, you must join Github and make at least four substantive contributions to this repository. The term all you engineers (and lawyers) can’t wait to parse is “substantive” to which I will always enter a judgment which I deem final in this class, and I am ever in favor of beneficence over stricture. So, just help out the class in a way you think is helpful and watch those around you do the same. Failure to contribute to this living document by the end of the semester for those in this class will result in a loss of up to 4\% of one's total grade outright.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item A form of energy resulting from the existence of charged particles 
	\item The physical phenomena arising from the existence, presence, and motion of charged particles
	\item Rather ill-defined in common vernacular – we will generally avoid its use
\end{enumerate}



\section{Charge}
 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Charge is the property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field; measured in coulombs (C)
	\item 	Charges are found in nature in discrete, integral multiples of electronic charge: e  = -1.602 x $10^{-19}$ C (the charge of one electron)
	\item \textbf{How many electrons are needed to form one coulomb?} (What is the weight of all those electrons?) 
	\item One byte is eight bits. Bits are essentially a single electron stored in a transistor. \textbf{If we were to take all the electrons from one terabyte of well distributed information (equal number of ones and zeros), how many coulombs would we have?}
\end{enumerate}


\section{Current}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The time rate of change of charge – charges (charged particles) in motion; measured in amperes; defined mathematically as
	\begin{equation}
	\label{i=dqdt}
		i := dq/dt
	\end{equation}
	where $i$ is current, $q$ is charge, and $t$ is time
	
	\item Conversely, the total charge transferred over time can be expressed as 
	\begin{equation}
	\label{q=it}
		Q := \int_{t_0}^{t}i dt
	\end{equation}

	\item 1 ampere is equal to 1 coulomb/second
	\item Direct current, ``DC'', is current that remains constant with time
	\item Alternating current, ``AC'', is current that varies sinusoidally with time
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{The directionality of current}
Ultimately, the direction in which we say "current" flows is largely arbitrary. As arbitrary as choosing one type of charge and calling it ``positive'' and another ``negative''. The reason it doesn't matter is that the only consequence of having chosen a ``wrong direction'' for the current in a given analysis is that we have to switch the sign of the value. Thus, 3 amps in one direction is \textit{the exact same thing }as -3 in the opposite direction.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Thanks to Benjamin Franklin we say that current is 
	\subitem i.	\textbf{Positive in the direction in which positively charged particles flow} and 
	\subitem ii.	\textbf{Negative in the direction in which negatively charged particles}
	\subitem iii.	We also now know that current results primarily from the movement of negatively charged particles (electrons) and therefore our convention is “wrong” in one sense, though convenient and entrenched enough that we’re not liable to change it in our life time (besides, the math comes out the same, and the actual flow of electrons will only matter to us in a few special circumstances, diodes)
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{The at times deadly serious nature of current}
Much of the point of learning this material here is its eventual application by our hands or by the hands of those we work with. Before we put any of this stuff in our hands, we should probably know what is and is not safe.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 1 mA, you will feel
	\item 10 mA, you will really feel
	\item 100 mA, you will likely die
	\item 1000 mA, you will definitely die
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{The ``speed'' of current}
A possible misconception is that the electrons inside a wire travels at the speed of light. The speed of current is actually relatively slow. If one were to imagine an electron starting at the wire next to a light switch in an average classroom, it would take a very long period of time for it to travel to the light itself. The light's immediate reaction to a switch is due to a ''hose effect''; the electrons inside the wire push other electrons in the direction opposite to the [conventional] current. This cascade of electrons is what happens close to the speed of light, not the electron movement itself.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item T\textbf{he \textit{signal} of electrical current (that is electromagnetic radiation) travels anywhere between about 50-99\% the speed of light} (dependent on a number of conditions) depending upon the material through which it travels (based on a “dielectric” behavior known as permittivity)
	\item \textbf{The drift velocity of electrons} within a copper wire is ~25 $\mu$m/s, so how does anything ever turn on?
	\item \textbf{The hose effect} - The electrons at the light switch will almost certainly never pass through a light bulb, but they will move around and bump into their neighbors which bump into their neighbors which bump into their neighbors, etc., until it causes the electrons nearest the light to pass through. This is how water at a spigot is able to push water at the end of a hose.
\end{enumerate}



\section{Potential (difference)}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The amount of work needed to move a unit of (positive) charge from a reference point to another point [without producing an acceleration]).
	\item Potential is measured in ``volts'' and is often called ``voltage''. In this class we will endeavor to avoid such a term as it can be very confusing to talk about potential as if there were such a \textit{thing} as voltage.
	\item Defined as 
	\begin{equation}
		v:= \frac{dw}{dq}
	\end{equation}
	\item Potential describes the \textit{potential} to do something. Increasing the potential is akin to increasing the height of a cliff. The height does not \textit{do} anything other than increase what can be done on the drop. If potential is the cliff's height, charge would be pebbles you'd drop off the side, and current describes how fast those pebble fall.
	\item In this class, and for the vast vast majority of electrical engineering work, we care about the \textit{difference} in potential. One element held at 100 billion volts and another held at 100 billion + 1 volts has a \textit{potential difference} of 1 V, which is less than a single AA battery.
	\item Some typical voltages to be aware of
	\subitem \textbf{Consumer level batteries} (AA, AAA): 1.5 V (DC); 9 V (DC) 
	\subitem \textbf{Car batteries}: 12 V (DC)
	\subitem \textbf{The ``mains''} (levels provided by power companies to consumers): 110-120 V (AC) and 220-240 V (AC) in America
	\subitem \textbf{Power transmission lines}: 110-1200 kV (AC), transformers are used to step up and down the potential before used by consumers
\end{enumerate}



\section{Power}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The time rate of expending or absorbing energy.
	\item Quantifies the rate of energy transfer.
	\item Mathematically:
	\begin{equation}
		p = \frac{dw}{dt} = \frac{dw}{dq}\cdot\frac{dq}{dt} = v\cdot i
	\end{equation}
	\item Measured in watts: 1 W = 1 $\frac{\text{J}}{\text{s}}$ = 1 $\frac{\text{N}\cdot \text{m}}{\text{s}}$ = 1 $\frac{\text{kg}\cdot \text{m}^2}{\text{s}^3}$ = 1 V $\cdot$ 1 A
	\item \textbf{Passive sign convention}: If current enters through the positive terminal of an element, $p = +vi$; if current enters through the negative terminal of an element, $p = -vi$.
\end{enumerate}



\section{Energy}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The capacity to do work.
	\item Measured in joules.
	\item $E = \int\frac{dw}{dt}dt \rightarrow$ power x time
	\item J = $\frac{\text{kg}\cdot\text{m}^2}{\text{s}^2}$ = N $\cdot$ m = Pa $\cdot$ m$^3$ = W $\cdot$ s = C $\cdot$ V
\end{enumerate}



\section{Conservation}
Here, as elsewhere, things will be conserved. In electrical circuits there are two laws of conservation that will matter most for us:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{The Conservation of Mass.} The conservation of mass means that no mass can be added to or removed from a circuit without being accounted for. Put differently, in a closed system (the type we will concern ourselves with here) no mass is added or removed.
	\subitem In electrical circuits, the mass we care the most about are the charges whipping around. Thus, for us, \textit{the amount of charge within a circuit must remain constant.}
	\item \textbf{The Conservation of Energy.} The conservation of energy means that no energy can be added to or removed from a circuit without being accounted for. Put differently, in a closed system (the type we will concern ourselves with here) no energy is added or removed.
	\subitem In electrical circuits, the energy we care the most about is the potential provided by sources and depleted by other elements in the circuits. Thus, for us, \textit{the sum of potentials within a circuit must equal zero.} 
\end{enumerate}

In evaluating circuits, the main focus of the first third of this class, it will be the application of these two conservative laws that will enable us to ``solve'' them. That is, by understanding (1) how energy is generated and used and (2) how charges move around in closed loops (``circuits'') we will be able to predict the behavior of the myriad electrical systems which may cross our paths.

\section{Active v. passive}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Active elements are capable of generating energy while passive components cannot
	\item \textbf{Active}: generators, batteries, operational amplifiers, ``sources''
	\item \textbf{Passive}: resistors, capacitors, inductors, i.e., most circuit elements
\end{enumerate}

\section{Ohm's Law and what it means}

Ohm's Law is concerned with the relationship between voltage, or potential difference, and current across a conductor.  The potential difference across a conductor is proportional to the current flowing thorugh the conductor with the proportionality constant being denoted as R, or resistance.  This can be expressed as:

	\begin{equation}
	\label{V=iR}
		V := iR
	\end{equation}
	
This essentially states that the drop in potential across the conductor, or resistor, is equivalent to the current flowing through the conductor and its resistance.  When considering impedance, the equation can be modified to state:

	\begin{equation}
	\label{V=iZ}
		V := iZ
	\end{equation}

\section{Sources}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{An ideal independent source} is an active element that provides a specified value of potential or current, regardless of other circuit elements.
	\subitem Batteries and power supplies may be approximated as ideal potential sources.
	\item \textbf{An ideal dependent (or controlled) source} is an active element in which the source quantity is controlled by another quantity (such as potential, current, temperature, measured resistance, etc.).
	\item \textbf{An ideal potential source} will produce any current required to ensure that the terminal voltage stated is satisfied.
	\item \textbf{An ideal current source} will produce any voltage required to ensure that the terminal current as stated is satisfied
	\item Symbols
	\subitem Voltage-controlled voltage source, VCVS
	\subitem Current-controlled voltage source, CCVS
	\subitem Voltage-controlled current source, VCCS
	\subitem Current-controlled current source, CCCS 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Resistors}
\textbf{Resistors} are electrical (circuit) elements that resist the flow of electric charge (current); passive two-terminal components that implement a defined/``constant'' resistance; meant to reduce current flow and change potential

\subsection{Resistance, $R$}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Resistance} is the physical property describing an element's ability to resist current and is most often represented by $R$
	\item Resistance is measured in ``ohms'', $\Omega$, which is equivalent to 1 V/A
	\item Resistance is one half of a broader physical phenomenon known as \textbf{``impedance''} - the property describing an element's ability to \textit{impede} current. Impedance is typically represented by $Z$, which we'll explore more thorough in a bit.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Resistivity, $\rho$}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The resistance of an element (such as a resistor) depends on three things: 
	\subitem \textbf{Resistivity}, $\rho$, of the material comprising the element, which is the \textit{material}'s ability to resist the flow of charges; measured in ohm-meters
	\subitem \textbf{Length}, $l$, of the element; measured in meters
	\subitem \textbf{Area}, $A$, of the cross-section of the element; measured in m$^2$
	\subitem Such that $R = \rho\frac{l}{A}$
	\subsubitem What units are we left with?
	\subsubitem What are the effects of length and area?
	\item \textbf{Materials with low resistivity} are generally called (and treated as) ``conductors'' as they are able to more effectively \textit{conduct} the motion of electrical charges than materials with high resistivity
	\item \textbf{Materials with very high resistivity} are generally used as ``insulators'' as they prevent the flow of current through them and thus \textit{insulate} the current within prescribed bounds, such as with a copper wire with plastic wrapped around it.
\end{enumerate}

Here is a link to a video that further explains the concepts of resistivity and resistance: \url{<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rsswT_Rv1M>}.

\subsection{Conductance}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The inverse of resistance is conductance, $G$, which describes the ability of an element to conduct current
	\item Measured in Siemens
	\item Allows us express Ohm's law slightly differently, $i = Gv$, which says that the current generated through an element by a potential is directly proportional to some constant, namely conductance.
	\item The material specific property \textbf{conductivity}, $\sigma$ is measured in S/m
\end{enumerate}

\section{Capacitors}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Passive two-terminal components that store energy in an electric field; introduces capacitance to a circuit.
	\item Can be thought of as two conductive plates sandwiching a ``dielectric'' material. Essentially it is two ``conductors'' separated by a ``non-conductive region''.
	\item When a capacitor is attached across a source, an electric field develops across the dielectric causing a net positive charge to collect on one conductor and a net negative charge to collect on the other.
	\item We can define the capacitance of an element mathematically as 
	\begin{equation}
		C = Q/V
	\end{equation}
	where $C$ is capacitance in farads, $Q$ is positive or negative charge on each conductor, and $V$ is the potential between them
	\item We can also represent capacitance by the voltage-based rate of charge accumulation: $C = dQ/dV$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Its time varying behavior}
Unlike resistors, capacitors have a \textit{time-varying} element to that. That is, since $C = Q/V$, $V = Q/C$.

If we then recall Equation \ref{q=it}, we can write the time-dependent potential relationship of a capacitor
\begin{equation}
	V(t) = \frac{Q(t)}{C} = \frac{1}{C}\int_{t_0}^{t} i(\tau) d\tau + V(t_0)
\end{equation}

We can also recall\footnote{We could also take the derivative of the equation preceding this one and do a little rearrangement. As it turns out, these physical relationships are rather codified and thus can be gotten out by any number of means.} Equation \ref{i=dqdt}, and represent the time-dependent current relationship as
\begin{equation}
	I(t) = \frac{dQ(t)}{dt} = C\frac{dV(t)}{dt}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Charge accumulation}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item While charges accumulate on a capacitor, no current flows \textit{through} the capacitor.
	\item \textbf{Well, then why use them? After awhile won't the current just stop?} Yes, indeed it will -- in a DC circuit!
	\item The capacitor will become ``charged'' over time, eventually reaching the same potential as that established across it, e.g., by a source. Since potential only ever travels down potential gradients, if the capacitor and the source (say, a battery) are at the same potential, no current will flow.
	\item Thus, a fully charged capacitor will act as an ``open'' circuit, while an uncharged capacitor will act as a ``short'' circuit.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{A simple example}
If we consider Ohm's law for a simple RC circuit (one in which a source, a resistor, and a capacitor are in series), we can describe the system by

\begin{align}
	V_0 &= v_{R}(t) + v_{C}(t) \\
	V_0 &= i(t)R + \frac{1}{C}\int_{t_0}^t i(\tau)d\tau
\end{align}
Taking the derivative of both sides:
\begin{align}
	0 &= R\frac{di(t)}{dt} + \frac{1}{C}i(t) \\
	0 &= RC\frac{di(t)}{dt} + i(t) \\
	i(t) &= \frac{V_0}{R}\cdot e^{-t/RC} \\
	v(t) &= V_0\left(1 - e^{-t/RC}\right) \\
	Q(t) &= C\cdot V_0\left(1 - e^{-t/RC}\right)
\end{align}

\subsection{Formal Calculus Derivation of Capacitor Charge Equation in RC Circuit}
In the following sketch, we are assuming that a battery is in series with a discharged capacitor and resistor. At t = 0, the circuit is connected and the capacitor will begin charging.

Let's start with a base equation. Since the battery, resistor, and capacitor are all in series, we can find that
\begin{equation}
	\label{Kirchoff}
V = IR + \frac{Q}{C}
\end{equation}
We can then further manipulate the equation to get
\begin{equation}
\frac{V}{R} =  I + \frac{Q}{RC}
\end{equation}
Isolate I to get
\begin{equation}
 \frac{V}{R} - \frac{Q}{RC} =  I
\end{equation}
We can find that I can be represented as the derivative of q with respect to time
\begin{equation}
\frac{V}{R} - \frac{Q}{RC} =  \frac{dQ}{dt}
\end{equation}
Combining the left hand side into one fraction:
\begin{equation}
\frac{CV - Q}{RC} =  \frac{dQ}{dt}
\end{equation}
By rules of separable equations, we can find that
\begin{equation}
\int_{0}^{Q} \frac{RC}{CV - Q}dQ = \int_{0}^{t} dt
\end{equation}
We can evaluate the definite integral with random charge based off time, Q(t) = Q, from Q(0) = 0 (This basically explains why the bounds of the integrals are the way that they are) 

We can evaluate the definite integral
\begin{equation}
-RC[\ln{(CV-Q)}]_{0}^{Q} = [t]_{0}^{t} dt
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
-RC[\ln{(CV-Q)}-\ln{CV}] = t
\end{equation}
Rearranging, we get
\begin{equation}
\ln{(1-\frac{Q}{CV})} = -\frac{t}{RC}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
1-\frac{Q}{CV} = e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
Q(t) = CV[1 - e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}]
\end{equation}
This is an equation that can be used at any point in time given that the capacitor was initially discharged.

\subsection{Capacitor Current Equation in RC Circuit}
With the charge equation above, we can easily take the derivative to find the current flow in a circuit for arbitrary time.
\begin{equation}
Q(t) = CV[1 - e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}]
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\frac{dQ}{dt} = -\frac{1}{RC}CVe^{-\frac{t}{RC}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
I(t) = -\frac{V}{R}e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}
\end{equation}

\section{Inductors}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Passive two-terminal components that store energy in a magnetic field
	\item Can be thought of as an insulated wire wound into a coil around a core (which may either be filled with a material or left open to the environment)
	\item Behavior can be modeled as $L = \frac{\Phi}{I}$, where $L$ is the inductance, $\Phi$ is the magnetic flux generated by a current, $I$.
	\item By Faraday's law of induction, voltage induced by a change in magnetic flux through a circuit is
	\begin{equation}
		v = \frac{d\Phi}{dt}
	\end{equation}
	which we can rewrite as
	\begin{equation}
		v = \frac{d}{dt}(Li) = L\frac{di}{dt}
	\end{equation}
	\item In this class, at this level, and for most biomedical applications you're liable to experience in your tenure, you will not work extensively with inductors. However, you should be able to recall at least this much at a moment's notice to be able to ascertain a system's behavior.
\end{enumerate}




\section{Impedance}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The measure of opposition a circuit element presents to a current when a potential is applied. (It is measured in ohms.)
	\item It is ``complex'' in two sense of the term. First, the actual phenomenon itself comprises complex numbers; that is, there is both a ``real'' and an ``imaginary'' component.
	\subitem \textbf{The real component} is known as resistance, $R$
	\subitem \textbf{The imaginary component} is known as reactance, $X$
	
	Impedance can be represented as a combination of either
	\subitem \textbf{Resistance and reactance}: $\mathbf{Z} = R + \jmath X$, where $\mathbf{Z}$ is impedance, $R$ is resistance, and $X$ is reactance, or
	\subitem \textbf{Magnitude and phase}: $\mathbf{Z} = |Z|e^{\jmath \theta}$, where $|Z|$ is the magnitude of the impedance vector, $\mathbf{Z}$, and $\theta$ is the phase of said vector (i.e., the delay between current and potential). Phase, $\theta$ is equivalent to $\tan^{-1}(X/R)$
	\item Impedance is also complex in the sense that it is complicated. The impedance of an object is a factor of many parameters including permittivity, geometry, quantum states, thermal stability, etc. Let us not view this sort of complexity as an impediment to our understanding of impedance.
	\item The inverse of impedance is \textbf{admittance}, $Y$, and comprises a real component, \textbf{conductance}, $G$, (which is the inverse of resistance) and an imaginary component, \textbf{susceptance}, $B$ (which is the inverse of reactance). (It is measured in Siemens.)
	\subitem $\mathbf{Y} = G + \jmath B$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{A quick note on ``imaginary'' numbers}
The term ``imaginary'' is an unfortunate name for an excellent mathematical tool. All the imaginary operator -- in this class represented by $\jmath = \sqrt{-1}$ -- is is a type of number ``orthogonal'' to our ``real'' numbers. Imaginary numbers are no less ``real'' than real numbers. Unfortunately, they aren't necessarily the most intuitive to our little mammalian brains and thus we must be trained to work with them. However, as we will see in this class, they can be quite useful.

\section{Equivalent impedance}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item It will often be more convenient to think about the impedance which a component burdens a system with (or the conductance which it affords) rather than its resistance. \textbf{Therefore, we need to begin to think in terms of equivalent impedances as we start to evaluate circuits.}
	\item Recall Ohm's law 
	\subitem \textbf{Resistors}, $v = iR \qquad \qquad \rightarrow Z_{eq,R} = R$
	\subitem \textbf{Capacitors}, $v = \frac{1}{C}\int i dt \quad \rightarrow Z_{eq,C} = \frac{1}{\jmath \omega C}$
	\subitem \textbf{Inductors}, $v = L\frac{di}{dt} \quad \qquad \rightarrow\jmath \omega L$
	
	I want to plant a flag here for you to notice the relationship between the $\jmath \omega$ terms from the capacitor and inductor and the corresponding derivative and integral forms of current in the Ohm's law representation. This will become very important once we get into the Laplace and Fourier transforms.
	\item We must also recognize that few will be the circuits comprising but a single element. As such, we should know how to find the equivalent impedance of many elements.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{A few examples}
\textbf{Example 1}
Find the equivalent resistance, if a resistor $R_1 = 10 \text{ k}\Omega$ is connected in parallel to $R_2 = 3.3 \text{ k}\Omega$.

\textit{Solution}. $R_{eq} = \frac{R_1 \cdot R_2}{R_1 + R_2} = \frac{(10)(3.3)}{10 + 3.3} = 2.48 \text{ k}\Omega$
\\
\\
\textbf{Example 2}
Find the equivalent resistance of three parallel-connected resistors of equal value. If $R = R_1 = R_2 = R_3 = 10 \text{ k}\Omega$, what's $R_{eq}$?

\textit{Solution}.
Recall, Equation \ref{req,par}
\begin{equation}
	\frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \frac{1}{R} + \frac{1}{R} + \frac{1}{R} \rightarrow 3R_{eq} = R \rightarrow R_{eq} = \frac{R}{3} \rightarrow R_{eq} = \frac{10k}{3} = 3.33 k\Omega
\end{equation}
\\
\\
\textbf{Example 3}
Four resistors are connected in parallel. $R_1 = 10 \text{ k}\Omega$, $R_2 = 1 \text{ k}\Omega$, $R_3 = 5 \text{ k}\Omega$, and $R_4 = 3 \text{ k}\Omega$. Calculate their equivalent resistance.
\begin{align}
	\frac{1}{R_{eq}} &= \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + \frac{1}{R_4} \\
	\frac{1}{R_{eq}} &= \frac{1}{10k} + \frac{1}{1k} + \frac{1}{5k} + \frac{1}{3k} \\
	&= 612.3 \text{ }\Omega
\end{align}

\section{Some details}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/op-amp1}
\\
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/op-amp2}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Behaves like a voltage-controlled voltage source
	\item They can amplify, sum, subtract, multiply, differentiate, integrate
	\item They are active circuit elements
	\item Though they have somewhat more complicated internal workings, we typically represent them in electrical circuits as a triangle with three (sometimes five) very important terminals:
	\subitem An inverting input ($—$ sign, typically represented up top for convenience, but it need not be)
	\subitem A non-inverting input (+ sign, typically on bottom)
	\subitem An output
	\subitem A positive power supply
	\subitem A negative power supply
\end{enumerate}

\section{Some rules}
There are \textbf{three important features of ideal operational amplifiers} that we must understand thoroughly. These are things worth stamping in your brain.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Infinite open-loop gain.} The ``A'' of the gain is infinitely large such that any difference in voltages $V_1$ and $V_2$ causes an enormously large output voltage. As much as is being supplied. (The real value of gain in most operational amplifiers is between $10^{5}$ and $10^8$.)
	\item \textbf{Infinite input impedance.} Current cannot travel between the inverting and non-inverting terminals. (Really, the impedance is between $10^5$ and $10^13$ ohms and is often signal dependent.)
	\item \textbf{Zero output impedance.} There is no loss transmitting a voltage difference to the output. (Really is about 10-100 ohms and is chip dependent.)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Some conveniences}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item With infinite input impedance, no current can flow into or out of the terminals and hence $i_1$ and $i_2$ are equal to 0.
	\item Since no current flows across the terminals, the terminals are at equal potential. Hence ``$v_1 = v_2$''.
\end{enumerate}

\newpage
\section{Some examples}

\subsection{Inverting amplifier}
We will apply the conservation of mass at this point to solve our equations.  This is among the simplest and most effective ways to add gain to a circuit. So much so that you will use it again and again and again in life and especially in labs

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/op-amp3}

We apply KCL at the node for v1
\begin{enumerate}

	\item Since the non-inverting amplifier is attached to the ground, $v_2 = 0$ 
	\item Using Rule 2 from earlier (Infinite Input Impedance) there is no current between v_1 and v_2. Therefore, $v_2 = v_1 = 0$
	\item From this we can conclude that $i_1 = i_2 = i$
	\item Using Ohm's Law ( $V = iR$) We can rewrite the equation in terms of current: $i = \frac{V}{R}
	\subitem $i_1 = \frac{v_i - v_1}{R_1}$
	\subitem $i_2 = \frac{v_1 - v_0}{R_f}$
	\item Using the known values from above, set the two current equations together and solve for $v_0$
	\subitem Known: $i_1 = i_2 = i$ and $v_2 = v_1 = 0$
	\subitem $ \frac{v_i - v_1}{R_1} = \frac{v_1 - v_0}{R_f}$
	\subitem $ \frac{v_i}{R_1} = \frac{-v_0}{R_f}$
	\subitem $v_0 = (\frac{-R_f}{R_1})*v_i $
	\item The gain factor is $\frac{R_f}{R_1}$

\end{enumerate}




\subsection{Non-inverting amplifier}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/op-amp4}

Again, the name might imply what it does. It will amplify our input signal without inverting it.

We can again perform Nodal analysis.
\begin{enumerate}

	\item Since the non-inverting amplifier is attached to the ground, $v_2 = v_i$ 
	\item Using Rule 2 from earlier (Infinite Input Impedance) there is no current between v_1 and v_2. Therefore, $v_2 = v_1 = v_i$
	\item From this we can conclude that $i_1 = i_2 = i$
	\item Using Ohm's Law ( $V = iR$) We can rewrite the equation in terms of current: $i = \frac{V}{R}
	\subitem $i_1 = \frac{v_g - v_1}{R_1}$
	\subitem $i_2 = \frac{v_1 - v_0}{R_f}$
	\item Using the known values from above, set the two current equations together and solve for $v_0$
	\subitem Known: $i_1 = i_2 = i$, $v_g = 0$, and $v_2 = v_1 = v_i$
	\subitem $\frac{v_g - v_i}{R_1} = \frac{v_i - v_0}{R_f}$
	\subitem $\frac{-v_i}{R_1} = \frac{v_i - v_0}{R_f}$
	\subitem $v_0 = (1+ \frac{R_f}{R_1})*v_i$
	\item The gain factor is $1+ \frac{R_f}{R_1}$

\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Voltage follower}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/op-amp5.png}

What if we didn’t have any resistors? $\rightarrow$ Vi = v2 = v1 = Vo $\rightarrow Vi = Vo$

This is used to transfer voltage without transferring current.
